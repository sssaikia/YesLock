But if you are one of those who likes to keep stuff on your home screen but also need an excellent app lock for your apps than you can use it as a normal lock application. \nSimply set a lock and select your fav home app.(Why not this? â˜¹ )\n
The app lock section includes locking of apps, with innovative kind of passwords, for those who like to try new stuffs, here you go. But if you don't like them, than you can always go back to using traditional alphabetical passwords.\n\n
